# Star Rating
## Overview
This project is a simple star rating system, allowing users to select a rating from 1 to 5 stars. As a user hovers over or clicks on a star, the stars update dynamically, and an emoji is displayed based on the selected rating. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fun and interactive rating component.


## Features
- **Interactive Star Ratings**: Hover and click effects change the star colors, reflecting the selected rating.
- **Emoji Feedback**: Based on the rating, an emoji will appear to show different emotions.
- **Smooth Animations**: Stars and emoji respond with smooth transitions for a polished user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling of the components, including transitions and colors.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity for the star rating and animations.
